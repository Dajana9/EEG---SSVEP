##  Electroencephalography - Steady state visually evoked potential

Electroencephalography is a method for measuring electrical activity of the
brain. In this research the attention has been focused on visual evoked
potentials and their measurement. It is presented how to use the tools for
measuring the potential caused by brain activities and the CCA algorithm
which is used for extracting high quality information. Using canonical
correlation revealed which electrodes gave us the best results. It turned out
that electrodes in the occipital lobe gave the best results. This discovery
helps us to make further measurements of the same subject much easier and
also gives us insight into the diversity of brain functions depending on the
location on the scalp.
