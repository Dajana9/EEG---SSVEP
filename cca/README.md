##  Electroencephalography - Steady state visually evoked potential

Electroencephalography is a method for measuring electrical activity of the
brain. In this research the attention has been focused on visual evoked
potentials and their measurement. Canonical correlation algorithm is used for
extracting information from electrodes. It turned out that electrodes in the 
occipital lobe gave the best results. In project are shown monopolar and bipolar
results. Monopolar are defined considering the referent electrode, and bipolar
as a differential of two electrodes.
This project gives us insight into the diversity of brain functions depending 
on the location on the scalp.
